# "binary" (COPY ... WITH BINARY, exercising postcode's/dps's binary
# send/recv functions -- a completely separate code path from the
# text-based tests that make up the rest of this suite) was never
# actually wired up to run: input/binary.source needs its @abs_srcdir@
# token substituted into a real sql/binary.sql before pg_regress can use
# it, and PGXS (unlike the full Postgres source tree's own regress
# GNUmakefile) doesn't supply that substitution rule automatically for
# out-of-tree extensions -- confirmed missing even in the pristine
# upstream 1.3.1 source, so this was never a working test, not something
# broken by the 1.3.2 fix. Added 2026-08-31.
#
# Substitutes a FIXED staging path, not $(CURDIR)/the real build
# directory -- so expected/binary.out (which necessarily contains the
# substituted path verbatim, since pg_regress diffs the echoed query
# text too) can be one portable, checked-in file that matches on any
# machine, not something that has to be regenerated per build location.
# (The previous expected/binary.out had the ORIGINAL upstream author's
# own literal dev path baked in -- /home/dave/dev/postcode/... -- which
# is exactly this same problem, unsolved.)
