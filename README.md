Postcode 1.3
============
UK postcode encoded in 32 bits and optimised for indexing and partial matches


Coverage
--------
Supports all 127 postcode areas. The crown dependencies GY, JE and IM and
Gibraltar's GX area are
included plus two non-geographic areas BX and BF.

The type should support all current and future codes with the sole exception
of the atypical code GIR 0AA, which Royal Mail nolonger includes within the
postcode address file. In the unlikely event further postcode areas are added
the type is extensible to a maximum of 255 areas (see areas.h)


Parsing
-------
Text input must match one of the above areas followed by a correctly specified
district, sector and walk. Although the type enforces entry of a code with the
correct components, confirming a code is allocated for use requires an external
data source such as [Code-Point Open](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk)

The text parser is relatively tolerant of varied formatting and will correct
for capitalisation and a variable number (or lack of) spaces between the
outward and inward codes.


Rendering
---------
When rendering postcodes to text the default output is upper case with a
single space between the outcode and incode. If an alternative format is
required a to_char() function is provided. The default output is equivalent
to calling to_char(postcode, 'AD SW');

Rendering never fails as of 1.3.3. A field that isn't a valid, complete
value -- which in practice means a range_lower()/range_upper() boundary
from a fragment short enough to leave something genuinely unfillable, or
truly corrupted data -- renders as `?` for whichever specific character
isn't available, rather than raising. A normal, complete postcode is
entirely unaffected (including the common case of a one-digit district,
e.g. `'SW1 1AA'`, which was always valid and still renders exactly as
entered).


Partial matching
----------------
For partial match queries using the % operator any potential ambiguity is
resolved by allocating the maximum number of digits to the district unless an
explicit space is placed between the district and sector.

For example % 'LS24' returns all postcodes in district LS24. To return all
codes in sector 4 of LS2 use % 'LS2 4'.

Neither or both characters of the walk must be entered. A partial search
including them is functionally equivalent to the equality = operator.

1.0 through 1.2, % was a plain function call, index-accelerated for
neither a constant nor a variable fragment. 1.3.0 registered it under
btree strategy 3 (the "equality" slot) to try to change that, but this
produced wrong results whenever an index existed on the column (upstream
issue #3): btree relies on strategy-3 matches being reflexive/
interchangeable, which a partial match isn't -- two different postcodes
can both match the same fragment without being equal to each other. 1.3.1
removed that registration, restoring correctness but leaving % unindexed
again either way, same as 1.0-1.2. Since 1.3.3, % gets an index-assisted
plan for a *constant* fragment (the common case: `code % 'LS24'`, not
`code % some_column`) via a planner support function that rewrites the
call into the range_lower()/range_upper() form below at plan time --
`EXPLAIN` will show a normal index scan, `code`'s own value is what's
compared, no opfamily trickery, none of 1.3.0's soundness bug. A
non-constant fragment still runs the plain, always-correct, unindexed
function, exactly as it always has. See Indexing below for the range
form itself, which is still the thing to reach for directly if you want
that plan guaranteed rather than inferred.


Indexing
--------
Standard B-tree operators are supported. The sort order is consistent with
that of the type rendered to text format using the C locale.

For an indexed partial match, use range_lower()/range_upper() instead of
%: they express a fragment as a genuine half-open range, using the
ordinary (and ordinarily correct) </>= operators for full index support:

    SELECT * FROM addresses
    WHERE postcode >= range_lower('LS24') AND postcode < range_upper('LS24');

Unlike %/!%, range_lower()/range_upper() raise an error on an invalid
fragment rather than silently returning a value -- they're meant to be
called with a literal, known-good fragment when constructing a query, not
with arbitrary/untrusted input.

Since 1.3.3, both bounds are real, valid, directly-renderable postcodes,
not raw internal values -- `range_lower('LS1')` is `'LS1 0AA'`,
`range_upper('LS1')` is `'LS10 0AA'` (the lowest real postcode of
whichever fragment immediately follows LS1 -- not, perhaps
counter-intuitively, `'LS2 ...'`: LS1 and LS10 share the same first
district digit and sort adjacently, LS2 doesn't come until every LS1x
district is exhausted -- the type's sort order matches the text form's
own left-to-right character order, so this is the same ordering
`ORDER BY postcode` or a plain text comparison would already give you).
This is why `EXPLAIN`'s output for the % rewrite above reads as real
postcodes too. The interval is always half-open and exclusive at the top
-- `range_upper(X)` is never itself included by a `< range_upper(X)`
comparison -- so it being a real postcode (specifically, the real lower
bound of whatever comes next) is exactly the tiling property that makes
adjacent fragments' ranges meet with no gap and no overlap, not a loose
end.

A B-tree index for the encoded type will be approximately 25% smaller than
an equivalent index on a column of type text. This may give a performance
advantage where the index can therefore be held entirely within memory.

Since 1.3.4, `<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=` (both `postcode` and `dps`) carry real
selectivity estimators (PostgreSQL's own standard `scalarltsel`/
`scalarlesel`/`scalargtsel`/`scalargesel` and join counterparts, the
same ones `int4`/`text`/`date` use for these operators) -- previously
unset entirely, which meant the planner had no way to use `ANALYZE`'s
own column statistics for a range predicate at all, regardless of how
accurate or fresh those statistics were, and would fall back to a fixed
default guess. Confirmed live against a real 34.8M-row table with an
existing plain `btree(postcode)` index and fresh statistics: the same
`BETWEEN range_lower/range_upper` query went from a ~39s sequential scan
to a 270ms index scan, no new index, no query change -- purely from the
planner now being able to see the real distribution.


Casting to/from text
---------------------
postcode::text and 'SW1A 1AA'::postcode already work without any of
this -- PostgreSQL falls back to any type's own input/output functions
for the `::` syntax even with no cast registered at all. What that
implicit fallback *doesn't* do is participate in ordinary function-
argument resolution or PostgreSQL's own internal dependent-object
rewriting (notably `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE`'s automatic index rebuild) --
both need a real `pg_cast` entry to work, which is what this adds.

    postcode AS text   -- IMPLICIT
    text AS postcode   -- ASSIGNMENT
    dps AS text        -- IMPLICIT
    text AS dps        -- ASSIGNMENT

Deliberately asymmetric. `<type> AS text` is IMPLICIT because that's the
direction real call sites actually need auto-coerced -- a functional
index like `split_part(postcode_col::text, ' ', 1)` needs `postcode_col`
to coerce into `split_part`'s text parameter automatically for
PostgreSQL to be able to re-resolve it during `ALTER COLUMN TYPE`'s
index rewrite, and PostgreSQL only ever auto-applies an IMPLICIT cast
for that kind of resolution -- an ASSIGNMENT cast (tried first) is only
auto-applied for INSERT/UPDATE target-column coercion, not general
argument matching, and doesn't actually fix this. `text AS <type>` stays
ASSIGNMENT: nothing in practice needs an arbitrary text value silently
coercing *into* postcode/dps in general expression contexts, and that
direction can raise on invalid input, which is a worse thing to have
fire implicitly than a render that always succeeds for a valid value.

Behaviour is otherwise unchanged either direction -- postcode_to_text()/
dps_to_text() are exactly what ::text already did; text_to_postcode()/
text_to_dps() are exactly what ::postcode/::dps already did, same strict
raise-on-invalid-input as always. topostcode() remains the NULL-safe
alternative for messy/untrusted input, unaffected by any of this.


Delivery point suffixes
-----------------------
For any postcode there is a maximum of 175 delivery points, each of which
is allocated a suffix of the form [1-9][A-Z] with the characters CIKMOV not
used. Suffixes follow the sequence 1A, 1B, 1C through to 9T. Codes 9U-9Z
are for use by applications as defaults where the correct suffix is unknown.

A suitable type (dps) is provided which encodes into one byte all possible
values, including codes 9U-9Z. Parsing is case insensitive but output is
always in upper case.

The type aims to provide strict validation rather than space efficiency,
although some small storage savings can be made compared to char(2) if
careful ordering of columns is made with respect to alignment.


Binary format
-------------
For client applications exchanging results in binary format the functions
declared in binfmt.h can be used for parsing from or rendering to text format
